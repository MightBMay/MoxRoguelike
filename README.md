# MoxRogue and MoxEngine
## MoxEngine
MoxEngine is a basic game engine i am making for more experiance with game engines, and c++ in general. it uses SFML 3.0 for most system related things (graphics, window creation, etc), as well as FMOD for more versitile audio.



## Moxrogue
Moxrouge is an idea i had for quite a while of a simple roguelike game, akin to vampire survivors, with a heavy theme around a DND character i made, which is a sentient cardboard box.
